### **Ticket 1: Rejected pull request from fork**
*To start, I have to say I LOVE GITHUB. You guys rock. I was at your 4th birthday party,
thanks for the cupcake and booze!
Anyway, here's my problem. I sent a pull request to technoweenie, and he rejected it because
my master branch is out of sync with his master. What can I do to fix this?
Help me supportocat, you're my only hope!

Hint: You'll want to address their question, and you could add an explanation of topic
branches as a better workflow.*

### **Ticket 2: Syncing internal server and GitHub?**
*Hi GitHub! My company has an internal Git server used for deployments, we use GitHub,
and I work on a local copy of the repository. For workflow purposes, how do I sync my
repository to GitHub and the internal Git server?
Thanks,
vmg
Hint: One common option is Git remotes. There are others!*

### **Ticket 3: Unhappy about forking**
*JamesTK here, I have another question.
One of my dev collaborator forked my private repo without explicit permission to do so... is
that typical? I am surprised that the system did not notify me if it was okay to grant the fork
permission. Is there a way to setup permissions of this sort? Also, other than asking the
collaborator to delete the forked repo, can I actually delete it?
Thanks, jamestk
Notes:
You've checked the account in our admin view, he only has one personal repository
(jamestk/tribbles), which has one collaborator. Any documentation you may need is available
on help.github.com.*
